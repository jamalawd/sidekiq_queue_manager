1. **Enable Authentication** (disabled by default for development)

   ```ruby
   # Enable basic auth
   config.basic_auth_enabled = true
   config.basic_auth_password = 'secure-password'
   
   # OR use custom authentication
   config.authentication_method = :authenticate_admin!
   ```

2. **Network Security**

   ```ruby
   # Mount behind authentication
   authenticated :admin do
     mount SidekiqQueueManager::Engine, at: '/admin/queues'
   end
   ```

3. **Critical Queue Protection**

   ```ruby
   config.critical_queues = ['billing', 'payments', 'notifications']
   ```

### Security Features

- **CSRF Protection** - Built-in Rails CSRF protection
- **Content Security Policy** - Configurable CSP headers
- **Request Logging** - Comprehensive request and action logging
